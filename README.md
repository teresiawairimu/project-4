## Linear Regression Project in Python

**Let's embark on a journey into the realm of linear regression! This project will guide you through building your own model from scratch in Python, exploring its fundamentals and applications.**

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic understanding of Python programming
* Familiarity with linear algebra (optional)

**Get Ready:**

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
    * This isolates your project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.
    * You can choose tools like `venv` or `virtualenv` to create and manage the environment.

2. **Install required libraries:**
    * Update `requirements.txt` with the following list:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
```

    * Then, install the libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your virtual environment.

**What You'll Build:**

* **Model from Scratch:**
    * Craft your own linear regression model using NumPy.
    * Witness the inner workings of this iterative learning algorithm firsthand.

* **Data Preparation and Analysis:**
    * Master essential data handling techniques like loading datasets, handling missing values, and feature standardization.
    * Explore the relationship between features and the target variable for deeper insights.

* **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**
    * Assess your model's performance with metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
    * Analyze predicted vs. actual values to understand how well your model fits the data.
    * Delve into the model coefficients to grasp the relative importance of each feature.

* **Prediction and Visualization:**
    * Use your trained model to predict values on new, unseen data points.
    * Visualize the linear regression line and data points for intuitive understanding.
    * Employ interactive plots and heatmaps to uncover hidden relationships between features and the target variable.
