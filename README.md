## Linear Regression Project in Python

**Overview:** This project implements linear regression from scratch in Python, exploring the fundamentals and applications of this popular machine learning technique.

**Features:**

* **Model Implementation:** Build a linear regression model from scratch, including gradient descent optimization.
* **Data Handling:** Load and prepare datasets for linear regression analysis.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
* **Prediction:** Make predictions on new data points using the trained model.
* **Visualization:** Explore the relationship between features and target variable with interactive plots.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-project.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd linear-regression-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the example:**

```bash
python example.py
```

**Usage:**

1. **Load and Preprocess Data:**

* Load your data using pandas.
* Handle missing values and outliers.
* Standardize features if necessary.

2. **Train the Model:**

* Instantiate a LinearRegression object.
* Define loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
* Implement gradient descent optimization to train the model.

3. **Evaluate Model Performance:**

* Calculate metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
* Analyze the relationship between predicted and actual values.

4. **Make Predictions:**

* Use the trained model to predict on unseen data points.
* Interpret the model coefficients to understand feature importance.

5. **Visualization:**

* Plot the linear regression line and data points.
* Visualize feature-target relationships with scatter plots and heatmaps.

**Dependencies:**

* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib
